ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Robert N. Winter
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a Philosopher and historian by training, Product Manager by pay cheque, and a doctoral candidate at [Macquarie University](https://www.mq.edu.au/about/about-the-university/faculties-and-departments/business/our-departments/department-of-management) researching Edmund Burke on authority and the implications for leadership.

## Supporting Research

While I consider myself a philosopher and writer, first and foremost, it is not how I earn my daily bread. As such, the effort and financial costs involved in running my various projects are freely and willingly donated by me as a labour of love.

Reward comes from the not infrequent critical feedback and words of praise. All of which acts as grist for the windmills of my mind and a spur to further output.

If I may ask one thing, it is that you reach out and let me know what you think about the content. Either via email or the social media platforms listed above.

That said â€” donations are gratefully accepted and faithfully applied to the ongoing maintenance expenses. Should you be so inclined, you can donate with one of the following services:

* [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/robertwinter/)
* [Buy Me A Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/robertwinter)
