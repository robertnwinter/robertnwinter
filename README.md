ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dr Robert N. Winter

ðŸ‘€ A trained historian and philosopher, I apply these disciplines to organisational and information technology research, informing my leadership of teams at the nexus of strategic management and program delivery. At present, I am enabling Standards Australia to achieve their organisational goals through a series of digital transformation projects.

I have fifteen yearsâ€™ experience managing concurrent project streams, with responsibility for operational and strategic excellence. My focus is on driving organisational efficiency, transparency, and effectiveness â€“ delivering successful program management solutions across Customer Success, Publishing Operations, International Engagement, eCommerce, Sales, and Marketing. I have a solid record of taking over troubled programs / projects, developing new delivery plans, and leading teams to the successful attainment of organisational goals.

## Supporting Research

While I consider myself a philosopher and writer, first and foremost, it is not how I earn my daily bread. As such, the effort and financial costs involved in running my various projects are freely and willingly donated by me as a labour of love.

Reward comes from the not infrequent critical feedback and words of praise. All of which acts as grist for the windmills of my mind and a spur to further output.

If I may ask one thing, it is that you reach out and let me know what you think about the content. Either via email or the social media platforms listed above.

That said â€” donations are gratefully accepted and faithfully applied to the ongoing maintenance expenses. Should you be so inclined, you can donate with one of the following services:
